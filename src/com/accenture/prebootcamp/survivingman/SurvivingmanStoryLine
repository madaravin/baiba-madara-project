Intro story-
The first thing you see when you open your eyes is a bright light. Your head feels hazy and your body- heavy.
You were on your way to fly to see your family, but the last thing you remember is the pilot yelling that the plane is about to crash.
Strangely, there is no one else around you, but you know that you have been laying there for a while as your mouth is dry and the plane
isn't burning anymore, there are just smoke coming from the shattered metal parts.
Your thoughts are disturbed by the sound of branches breaking under someone's feet.
You hide behind a plane wing and see a tribe coming in your direction.
They don't look friendly, with spears in their hands and their faces painted red and black.
You remember reading in a facebook post, that your crazy aunt posted, about tribes that paint their faces this way
eat human flesh of lost travellers unless...
Unless you tell them the magic word... what was the magic word?

You tell them the word and they take you to the nearest village where you meet people
who are just about to fly to the same place you were going! You're the happiest person on earth...
And then you wake up. It was all a dream."

*for false answer.
"Wrong guess! You are awoken from your nap as the tribe has their spears pointed towards you.
You have no escape, your pet is nowhere to be seen and you start to think about the afterlife.
They bring you to their village, where they have prepared a large pot for you to boil in and
they will make a delicious borsch from you. While your screaming for your life,
you suddenly wake up in your bed, at home. It was all just a nightmare and you decide to never read facebook articles again. "
